# Intro to Agile

## What is Agile
* An iterative approach to development


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/7048/6865783267_a988ed645a.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Four principles
* Individuals & interactions over processes and tools
* Working products over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/7048/6865783267_a988ed645a.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
* Client driven - involve the client throughout the process
* Iterative process allows us to respond to user & client input
* Try to get a working product as early as possible and then build on that

### Why?
* Get early feedback from users
* Reduced risk and cost

## Scrum


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5506464427_ee488e47c4_b.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Scrum
* Work is completed in a series of short sprints
	* Breaks a big project into small pieces
* Each sprint will deliver an agreed 'artifact'
* They provide an opportunity to get feedback from the client and users
* Provide an opportunity to pivot if something doesn't work


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5506464427_ee488e47c4_b.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Scum Process
* Confined to a short period of time. e.g. 2 weeks
* Four meetings
	* Sprint planning meeting
	* Daily standup
	* Sprint review
	* Sprint retrospective


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5506464427_ee488e47c4_b.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Sprint planning meeting
This meeting is conducted before starting a sprint and may involve the product owner and stakeholders
* Determine work to complete in the sprint


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5506464427_ee488e47c4_b.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Stand up
Daily 10-15 minute meeting with the development team. Each participant answers three questions:
* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* Is anything blocking my ability to complete my task(s)

Conducted "standing up" to avoid lengthy discussions. These can be conducted with required parties after the meeting.

### Sprint Review
Meeting at the end of a sprint to review the work completed.
* Completed work is demonstrated to stakeholders
* Get feedback from stakeholders


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5506464427_ee488e47c4_b.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Sprint Retrospective
A meeting with the development team to reflect on the previous sprint.
* What worked?
* What didn't work?
* Can the process be improved


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://live.staticflickr.com/5296/5506464427_ee488e47c4_b.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### How I apply sprints
* I combine the sprint review and planning meetings.
	* First demo the completed work to the client.
	* After demonstration I bring up the outstanding tasks
		* Do we need to add any new tasks after the demo?
		* Select the highest priority tasks
* Daily standup at a 'Kanban board'
* Informal retrospective for a small team

## Kanban


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
## Kanban
* A method to visualise work progress
* Can use a tool like Trello and/or a physical board
* Defines and facilitates task workflow


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Using Kanban
* Tasks are written up as cards
* Cards are placed on a Kanban board
* Members of the development team select a card from the board
	* Move the card to indicate progress


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg"  data-background-color="black" -->
### Creating Kanban cards
* A card should be small enough to indicate progress
	* Usually something you can complete in a day
* Cards should be big enough that you can buckle down and work without worrying about updating your progress
* It takes practice to get this right - the sprint retrospective meeting is a great place to discuss this
