## I depend on google.

Gmail manages my email, travel and purchases


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/calendar-1763587.png" -->
Google Calendar doesn't just track my appointments but also tells me when to leave 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/World_location_map_%28equirectangular_180%29.svg" -->
Google location services helps calendar know when I need to leave for my appointments and also helps me find that cool bar I visited two weeks ago but can't remember the name of

When google home came out I went to JB every day until they had them in stock.

My girlfriend calls it my other girlfriend.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

As good as duck duck go is, I still can't give up google search


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/programmer-1653351.png" -->
I did replace chrome with Firefox for my primary browser but still love chrome dev tools too much to quit cold turkey 



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Surveillance-camera.png" -->
## Google knows everything about me 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/secret-3037639_1280.jpg" -->
* Where I live
* Where I go <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* What I buy <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* What sites I visit <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* The awkward questions that come up over drinks with friends <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Facebook-logo-thumbs-up.png" -->
But I'm ok with this


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/advertise-advertisement-advertising-747227.jpg" -->
* If I could pay money for google services I would 
* But Google doesn't want to sell their products to me <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Google wants to sell advertising <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* And that's OK <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* I choose to trade my information for their services <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/shopping-online-ecommerce-business-buying-card-1449091-pxhere.com.jpg" -->
My privacy belongs to me. It is mine to sell 



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Not_facebook_dislike_thumbs_down.png" -->
## But I'm not ok with Google analytics 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/pexels-photo-1352105.jpeg" -->
Your privacy is not mine to sell


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/writing-hand-table-pen-pattern-finger-552455-pxhere.com.jpg" -->
When we use google analytics we get great usage data 

* But we don't pay with our privacy  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* We pay with our users privacy <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dog-3079204_1280.jpeg" -->
Our users don't know that by visiting your site about dog grooming that they're telling google their dog's hair needs some attention 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/medicine-2207622_1280.jpg" -->
They don't know that by visiting your medical advice website that they're telling google their medical conditions 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Pregnancy_test_36068237046.jpg" -->
They don't know that by visiting your site about options for an unwanted pregnancy that they're telling google they're pregnant and didn't plan to be 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Google_web_search.png" -->
* They might have used google search to get there any already told google about this 
* But they might not have  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/analytics-1925495_1920.png" -->
* Analytics tells google much more than the sites they open from search 
	* It tells them where you go inside your website <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
	* It tells them how long you spend on those pages  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
	* It tells them if you "convert" <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
	* It tells them that you bookmarked a site and regularly visit it  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
despite google advocating ssl to conceal this from network providers https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https#https_protects_the_privacy_and_security_of_your_users


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/graphic-1142957_1920.jpg" -->
* The Website owner gets analytics for selling your privacy 
* But you don't get anything for giving them this information  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

And this is not OK  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/graphic-1142957_1920.jpg" -->
* But google analytics is great 
* My managers love google analytics  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* It provides an enormous amount of user data even if it isn't always clear what that data means  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* And it is free  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/graphic-1142957_1920.jpg" -->
* Many websites have a revenue source
* If that user data is valuable, the consumer of that data should pay for it, not the visitors  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Admittedly google has fantastic demographic information you can pay for, but it still sells your user's data.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Plaque_outside_the_Rhode_Island_Attorney_General%27s_office.jpg" -->
## Using analytics properly is your responsibility


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/gdpr.jpg" -->
* You must notify users you are using google analytics in your privacy policy
* GDPR also requires you to notify your users that you use google analytics <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Did you remember to include it in your privacy policy? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* How many users read privacy policies? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/avatar-159236_1280.png" -->
But google only collects aggregate information and does not gather personally identifying data

"You will not assist or permit any third party to, pass information to Google that Google could use or recognize as personally identifiable information. " <!-- .element: class="quote__text" -->

https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html <!-- .element: class="quote__source" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/man-156584_1280.png" -->
* But while you cannot store names, emails or IPs, you [can generate IDs that allow you to identify users](https://davidsimpson.me/2013/10/17/identifying-your-users-in-google-analytics-while-complying-with-section-7-of-the-terms-of-service/)
* Google provides session tracking and user profile information. So presumably they engage in these same practices



<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#fff" data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Circle-question.svg" -->
## So what do we do?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/analytics-2158454_1280.png" -->
There are a range of paid analytics services

Ranging from $8 - $1000 a month depending on your needs


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/logs-690888_1280.jpg" -->
Long before google analytics we used log analysers like AWStats to understand our traffic


<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#fff" data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Open_Source_Initiative_keyhole.svg/1024px-Open_Source_Initiative_keyhole.svg.png" -->
Open source tools like Matomo and OWA can be run locally if you would rather run your own instance than pay for hosted analytics


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/analytics-3680198_1280.png" -->
I'm not saying that you should never user google analytics

The feature sets offered by different platforms vary and cheaper alternatives may not offer the same degree of information as google analytics


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/choice-1513417749fx1.jpg" -->
But choosing to use google analytics should be a considered choice, not the default option because it is "free". 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/invoice-cash-payments-concept-business-receipt-1452877-pxhere.com.jpg" -->
I know budgets are tight but if you make money from your users, please take a moment to consider how your decisions affect them.


<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#fff" data-background-image="images/communicate-2028004_1280.png" -->
And if you use Google Analytics be sure to tell your users
