## What headsets do people use
<div class="chart-container chart-small">

Note:
"Canalys defines a virtual reality headset as a device with a display designed to be worn on the face that immerses the viewer in a virtual world, and it excludes simple viewers, such as Samsung’s Gear VR and Google’s Daydream View"

### Ok. What did people use in 2016?
<div class="chart-container chart-small">
	<div id="vr-headset-2016"></div>
</div>


### So?
* Advanced VR headsets are coming
* But most people are on cardboard or gear VR
* Can we develop for all of them?



## AFrame
* Handles all major VR headsets
* Can handle controllers and position tracking
* Also works on cardboard
* Can even work with no headset


### Using AFrame
* Import the JS library
* Create a 3D scene using HTML markup

## Components
* Import pre-build or custom aframe components


### Animation


### Models


### Lighting


### Controls


## Custom components


## AR.js
